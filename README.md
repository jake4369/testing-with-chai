Assertions in the Mocha and Chai testing frameworks are statements used to validate that a particular condition is true during testing.They are essential in unit testing as they help determine if the code behaves as expected.

### Mocha

Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework that runs on Node.js and in the browser. It provides a robust set of tools for writing and running tests, but it does not include built-in assertion libraries. Instead, it allows you to use any assertion library you prefer, such as Chai.
